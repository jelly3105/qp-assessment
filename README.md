I've created above project using MongoDB so that anyone can test the functionality on the system. I can use relational database as well. I've provided .env file details and steps to run the project.

# .env
PORT = 3000
DBPASSWORD = Anjali123$$
JWTSECRET= passwordKey

# Steps 
1. Clone the project on your system.
2. Run the command `npm install`.
3. Create .env file and copy the above content.
4. Run the command `npm run dev`.
